## Samaritan Worker Resource Center Application 

#About WRC App
The PayPal Hackathon gives us a unique opportunity to demonstrate how
technology can help them and modernize a process that is currently done
with pen and paper and a tomobola lottery system for choosing who gets
the opportunity to work. The application will provide a facilitation
service to allow workers and employers to connect and facilitate the
matching of workers and employers.

Technology can be a real enabler for link Samaritan House and
specifically the Worker Resource Center.
