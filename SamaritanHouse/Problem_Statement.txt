Problem Statement

Technology can be a real enabler for link Samaritan House and specifically the Worker Resource Center.  The PayPal Hackathon gives us a unique opportunity to demonstrate how technology can help them and modernize a process that is currently done with pen and paper and a tomobola lottery system for choosing who gets the opportunity to work. The application will provide a facilitation service to allow workers and employers to connect and facilitate the matching of workers and employers

The Appplication will:
  Allow workers to register
  Allow employers to register
  Allow employers to submit jobs
  Allow employers to manage jobs
  Allow the WRC to match workers to jobs
  Allow the WRC feedback to employers
  Allow the WRC to send surveys to employers and solicit feedback from workers.
